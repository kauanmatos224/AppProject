   It is notorious that the frequent increase in school material losses by Etec Lauro Gomes students has increased the volume of objects in the Lost and Found sector of that school. Therefore, many students do not find the lost material, be it of any value. In addition to these occasional losses, we have losses due to school materials loaned to other people in the school environment, who do not return them. Thus, by carrying out a field survey, it was demonstrated that about 97% of students had lost school materials due to loans, and that they would want an application that would help them in a simple and practical way to manage their school items. more efficient and safer way. Through this scenario, the application appears to facilitate the management of the student's school material, consisting of a system that performs the registration of the bearer's items and controls their loans, as well as manages their possible losses, in which case it sends the social network of the class group and the school's Lost and Found a report with the main characteristics of the object and a request for its return. Therefore, this solution aims to reduce the loss of financial resources, time and effort, from people due to the replacement of lost materials. In this way, through the construction of a prototype of the application, tests were carried out in field research, which demonstrated that about 91% of those surveyed approved the application and would use it in the management of school materials, such as in the recovery of lost materials using the social networks of the class group and the lost and found sector of the school to disseminate these materials. In view of the above, it can be stated that the use of the application demonstrates the possibility of great improvement in the organization of the students' materials. Therefore, the applicability of the solution on a commercial scale is notorious, mainly due to the fact that it is the only one available in the market with such nature.

KEYWORDS: Application. Loan. Materials. Organization. Loss.
